# CSR List
Control/Status Register and other privileged info for ISA.

ISA: RV32IMAC_Zicsr_Zifencei Sv32

## General Rules
- csr[11:0]
    - csr[11:10]
        - 00, 01, 10:
            - read/write
        - 11:
            - read-only
    - csr[9:8]
        - lowest executing privilege level that can access
        - 00:
            - User/Application
            - U-mode
        - 01:
            - Supervisor
            - S-mode
        - 10:
            - reserved
        - 11:
            - Machine
            - M-mode
- CSR's have associated privilege level where this privilege level and higher privilege levels can access it
    - raise illegal instruction exception if current privilege level not allowed to access CSR
- raise illegal instruciton exception if try to write to read-only register
    - writes to read-only fields of read/write registers are simply ignored
- dependent CSR's can affect the value of fields of other CSR's if a write to the CSR affects a dependent CSR's field
    - these value modifications do not cause CSR write side affects for the dependent CSR
- implicit CSR reads are equivalent in affect of explicit CSR reads
    - i.e. satp CSR modifications must propagate immediately
- unsupported CSR -> raise illegal instruction

### CSR Fields
- WPRI
    - Reserved Writes Preserve Values, Reads Ignore Values
    - SW's job to maintain value if not writing to field
    - if unused: read-only zero
- WLRL
    - Write/Read Only Legal Values
    - only have to support legal values
    - OPTIONAL: raise illegal-instruction exception if SW writes illegal value
    - always read legal values unless wrote illegal value previously
- WARL
    - Write Any Values, Read Legal Values
    - SW can test field to see legal values by trying to write value and see what gets read
    - no exceptions if illegal value
    - always read legal values unless wrote illegal value previously


## ISA CSR's
- ISA defined per-core Control/Status Registers
- listing all of the RISC-V standard M, S, and U mode CSR's, and explicitly vetoing the ones which are unsupported
    - H mode CSR's are also standard, but none of them are supported

### Machine CSR's
- M-mode-only accessible CSR's

            - SIE:
                - S-mode interrupt enable
                - enable interrupts when executing in S-mode
                - WARL
            - regardless of these values, still never get interrupted by interrupts for lower privilege modes
                - M-mode execution cannot be interrupted by S-mode level interrupt
            - regardless of these value, can still get interrupted by interrupts for higher privilege modes
                - S-mode execution can always be interrupted by M-mode level interrupt
                - U-mode execution can always be interrupted by M-mode or S-mode level interrupts
        - MPIE, SPIE, MPP, SPP: 
            - previous interrupt enables and privilege modes
            - make up two-level privilege mode stack
                - two-level in that save current and previous mode info
                - SW must be careful to maintain this stack e.g. guarantee no exceptions while saving privilege mode stack
            - MPIE:
                - M-mode previous interrupt enable
                - MIE value before this trap
                    - SW can restore MIE to this MPIE value if wants to disable interrupts to take care of this trap
                - WARL
            - SPIE:
                - S-mode previous interrupt enable
                - SIE value before this trap

                - 1: previously S-mode
                - WARL
            - HW support:
                - trap to M-mode
                    - MPIE <= MIE
                    - MIE <= 1'b0
                    - MPP <= mode trapped from
                - trap to S-mode

        - MPRV:
            - Modify Privilege
            - MPRV = 0:
                - use executing privilege mode's DATA (load/store/amo) memory translation and protection rules
            - MPRV = 1:
                - use DATA (load/store/amo) memory translation and protection rules designated by the MPP privilege mode
            - WARL
            - essentially, SW can enable translation and protection for M-mode loads and stores
                - e.g. misaligned load, can directly use virtual address that S-mode or U-mode tried to access
            - MPRV = 0 guaranteed for U-mode and S-mode
            - MPRV = 0 OR MPRV = 1 for M-mode

            - MXR = 1:
                - allow loads from pages with X=1 or R=1
            - WARL
            - implies MPRV = 1 for this field to be relevant, when trying to do a translated and protected load in M-mode
        - SUM:
            - permit Supervisor User Memory access
            - SUM = 0:
                - S-mode load/store accesses to U=1 pages will fault
            - SUM = 1:
                - S-mode load/store accesses to U=1 pages are permitted
            - WARL
            - implies translation and protection in effect for this field to have an effect
            - S-mode instruction execute access to U=1 pages always faults
            - relevant to M-mode when MPRV=1 & MPP=S-mode
                - this is when DATA memory accesses are effectively S-mode accesses
        - MBE, SBE, UBE:
            - byte endianness for DATA memory accesses
                - instruction accesses always little-endian

            - TVM = 1:
                - satp CSR reads/writes and SFENCE.VMA raise an illegal-instruction exception in S-mode 
            - WARL
        - TW:
            - Timeout Wait
            - TW = 0:
                - S-mode can freely execute WFI
            - TW = 1:
                - S-mode use of WFI either:
                    - waits for bounded time before completing
                    - gives illegal instruction
            - WARL
            - U-mode use of WFI always either:
                - waits for bounded time before completing
                - gives illegal instruction
            - simple: 
                - TW = 1 & S-mode immediately gives illegal instruction
                - U-mode WFI always immediately gives illegal instruction
        - TSR:
            - Trap SRET
            - TSR = 0:
                - SRET is permitted in S-mode
            - TSR = 1:
                - SRET in S-mode raises illegal-instruction exception
            - WARL
        - FS, VS, XS, SD:
            - extension context status
                - 2 bits each for {Off, Initial, Clean, Dirty} states
            - FS[1:0]:
                - FPU state encoding

            - WARL
                - will ignore writes
                    - else would need to be able to dynamically change XLEN
            - 2'b01 to denote XLEN = 32
        - Extensions[25:0] = 26'b00000101000001000100000101

- 0x302: medeleg
    - machine exception delegation
    - MRW
    - all exceptions trap to M-mode by default
    - set bits in medeleg, medelegh for corresponding exceptions to trap to S-mode when executing in S-mode or U-mode
        - corresponding exceptions executing in M-mode still trap to M-mode
    - bit indexes correspond to mcause bit indexes
        - following Interrupt = 1'b0
    - HW support for delegated exception:
        - set scause
        - set sepc
        - set stval
        - set mstatus.SPP following execution mode when trapped
        - set mstatus.SIE = 0
    - HW support for all bits as writeable 0 or 1:
        - means HW support for any exception delegatable

            - medeleg[11] = 1'b0
- 0x303: mideleg
    - machine interrupt delegation
    - MRW
    - mostly same semantics as medeleg but for interrupts
    - delegated interrupts are ignored in M-mode
        - instead of interrupting to M-mode if executing in M-mode, these are now ignored
    - bit indexes correspond to mcause bit indexes
        - following Interrupt = 1'b1
    - no midelegh
- 0x304: mie
    - machine interrupt enable
    - MRW
    - bit indexes correspond to mcause bit indexes
        - following Interrupt = 1'b1
    - when interrupt into M-mode for interrupt i:
        - either:
            - executing in M-mode and mstatus.MIE = 1'b1
            - executing in S-mode OR U-mode
        - mip[i] = 1'b1 & mie[i] = 1'b1
        - mideleg[i] = 1'b0
    - propagate changes to mip, mie, mstatus, mideleg immediately on MRET, SRET, and dependent CSR writes
    - M-mode interrupts take priority over S-mode delegated interrupts
    - bits of supported interrupts can be written by CSR writes
    - bits of unsupported interrupts are read-only zero

        - upper16[15:0] = 16'h0:
            - upper 16 bits are platform defined
            - HW custom interrupts here
                - none planned right now
        - LCOFIE = 1'b0:

                - two-level in that save current and previous mode info

#### Config
- 0x10A: senvcfg
    - supervisor environment config
    - SRW
    - no senvcfgh
    - {WPRI[23:0], CBZE, CBCFE, CBIE[1:0], WPRI[2:0], FIOM}
        - FIOM:
            - Fence of I/O implies Memory
            - relevant for S-mode and U-mode
            - keep WARL but has no effect since all fence's imply both I/O and memory fenced
                - fundamental reason did this is because can't figure out if address is to I/O vs. memory until after dtlb, which is too late to enact an acquire for this platform
                    - this platform uses stall_mem_read in dispatch
                - consider changing for this platform
        - CBZE = 1'b0:
            - unratified Zicboz extension unsupported
        - {CBCFE, CBIE[1:0]} = 3'b000:
            - unratified Zicbom extension unsupported
        - PMM = 1'b0:
            - unratified Smnpm extension unsupported
    - really just 1-bit FIOM, which is bit unused by HW that can be written by SW, rest read-only zero

#### Counter Setup
- 0x120: scountinhibit
    - supervisor counter-inhibit
    - SRW
    - unsupported
        - used by Smcdeleg Extension for counter delegation

#### Trap Handling
- 0x140: sscratch
    - scratch register for supervisor trap handlers
    - SRW
        - just read/write reg
    - separate from mscratch
        - for S mode purposes
    - typically used to store pointer to hart-local suprvisor context while hart executing in U
- 0x141: sepc
    - supervisor exception PC
    - SRW
    - separate from mepc
        - want separate exception information per execution mode
    - {sepc[31:1], 1'b0}
        - HW sets sepc[31:1] with the PC of the instruction interrupted or the instruction that raised the exception on a trap to S-mode
        - SW can freely write sepc[31:1]
- 0x142: scause
    - supervisor trap cause
    - SRW
    - separate from mcause
        - want separate exception information per execution mode
        - scause supports subset of non-M-mode bits in mcause, but should be separate hardware so that S-mode can track its own exception information
    - {Interrupt, Exception Code[30:0]}
        - Interrupt:
            - if interrupt, HW sets Interrupt = 1'b1
            - if exception, HW sets Interrupt = 1'b0
        - Exception Code[30:0]:
            - HW sets corresponding Exception Code bit
                - seems like only set highest exception: i.e. one hot
                - also seems like must cleanly order an interrupt vs. an exception since can't report both same cycle

        - SEIP:
            - S External Interrupt Pending
            - read-only by CSR instr's

        - STIP:
            - S Timer Interrupt Pending
            - read-only by CSR instr's
                - M-mode will get MTIP trap, take care of timer details, then write STIP with CSR instr so S mode can get timer interrupt
        - SSIP:
            - S Software Interrupt Pending
            - writable by CSR instr's
                - probably so S-mode can clear self since S mode will not be touching IPI MMCSR's
                - self S-mode signal also possible since can set as well
            - also set by IPI MMCSR's
                - not cleared since that's M-mode's job to use IPI MMCSR's?

                - PA = VA
                    - assuming zero-extended

            - full WARL
        - PPN:
            - PPN of page table for this context
            - essentially PTBR
            - full WARL
    - satp updates don't perform any ordering or synchronization of page table updates
        - this is SFENCE.VMA's job
        - not strictly necessary on some context switches, and as such SFENCE.VMA can be skipped, so performance will improve

## Privileged Instructions

### Environment Call and Breakpoint
- ECALL
    - in U-mode: raise environment-call-from-U-mode exception
    - in S-mode: raise environment-call-from-S-mode exception
    - in M-mode: raise environment-call-from-M-mode exception
    - if exception delegated to S-mode:
        - set sepc with address of ECALL
    - if exception to M-mode:
        - set mepc with address of ECALL
- EBREAK, C.EBREAK
    - raise breakpoint exception
    - if exception delegated to S-mode:
        - set sepc with address of ECALL
    - if exception to M-mode:
        - set mpec with address of ECALL

### Trap Return
- MRET
    - pop M-mode privilege stack
        - set execution mode <= MPP
        - set MIE <= MPIE
        - set MPIE <= 1'b1
        - set MPP <= 2'b00 (U-mode)
        - set MPRV <= 1'b0 if MPP != 2'b11 (M-mode)
    - set PC <= mepc
    - permitted in M-mode
- SRET
    - pop S-mode privilege stack
        - set execution mode <= SPP
        - set SIE <= SPIE
        - set SPIE <= 1'b1
        - set SPP <= 1'b0 (U-mode)
        - set MPRV <= 1'b0
    - set PC <= sepc

### Wait for Interrupt
- WFI
    - permitted in M-mode
    - permitted in S-mode if mstatus.TW = 0
    - permitted in S-mode but with HW time limit if mstatus.TW = 1
    - permitted in U-mode but with HW time limit
    - can use to signal to PLIC that this hart prime for external interrupts
    - WFI wakeup ignores mstatus.MIE, mstatus.SIE, always resuming execution after the WFI even if an interrupt won't be taken due to enable's being off for this mode
        - allows spooky in-current-code interrupt handling as opposed to trap jump
    - WFI wakeup ignores mideleg settings, always resuming execution after the WFI even if the interrupt wouldn't be taken in M-mode
    - WFI wakeup doesn't occur if the individual interrupt is not enabled via mie
        - allows mie to be true mask over mip functionality
    - if take interrupt, set mpec <= pc + 4, instr after WFI

- mcause
    - give reset condition
    - can use platform-specific conditions (e.g. interrupt=1, [16:30] causes)
    - can be 32'h0 for no special interpretation of reset
- everything else undefined, seems like just choose logical reset val
    - WARL's must be legal value


## Sv32 Paging
- Sv32 Mode
    - satp.MODE = 1
    - use paging in S-mode or U-mode

### Sv32 Page Table Entry
- {PPN1[11:0], PPN0[9:0], RSW[1:0], D, A, G, U, X, W, R, V}
    - V: valid
        - true valid when V = 1
        - all other bits don't cares if V = 0
        - if access PTE with V = 0, page fault
    - X, W, R:
        - X: execute permissions
            - can fetch instructions from page
            - can also load or LR.W from page if m/sstatus.MXR = 1
        - W: write permissions
            - can store, SC.W, or AMO to page
        - R: read permissions
            - can load or LR.W from page
        - case (X, W, R):
            - 000: pointer to next level of page table
                - page fault if already at level 0 leaf
            - 001: read-only
            - 010: reserved -> page fault
            - 011: read-write -> page fault
            - 100: execute-only
            - 101: read-execute
            - 110: reserved -> page fault
            - 111: read-write-execute
        - if get leaf page at level 1, have superpage
            - must have PPN0 == '0, else misaligned superpage, page fault
        - page fault of perform memory access and don't have required permissions
    - U:
        - U-mode accessible
        - only relevant for leaf pages
        - U = 1:
            - U-mode can access
            - if sstatus.SUM = 1, S-mode can access
        - U = 0:
            - U-mode cannot access
            - S-mode can access
    - G:
        - Global mapping
        - mapping true for all ASID's
        - if non-leaf PTE is G, all leaves under this are G
        - can share TLB entry between ASID's
        - don't have to flush G TLB entries on SFENCE.VMA if rs2 doesn't pick x0, so only targetting ASID instead of all
    - RSW = 2'b00
        - reserved
    - A, D:
        - A: 
            - Accessed
            - set on instruction fetch, data read, or data write
                - sets for fetches and reads can be speculative
        - D: 
            - Dirty
            - set on write
        - only relevant for leaf pages
        - updates to these must be ordered before the access causing the update
            - TLB miss until update is visible
        - functionality requirements:
            - updates must be performed as coherent writes
            - ideally don't need to snoop into TLB's and page table walkers, as these already have software synchronization via SFENCE.VMA
        - idea: full MMU coherence
            - gets performance benefit of sharing TLB capacity among cores if there is sharing
            - means MMU caches must be inclusive and follow 64B cache block granularity
                - RIP if have page table sparsity
            - may get functionality issues with untimely TLB updates not controlled by SFENCE.VMA
        - idea: BusInv + BusWB
            - MMU performs BusInv to invalidate any copies of PTE in coherent memory
            - MMU performs masked BusWB to write new PTE value to coherent memory (so essentially at L3)
            - issue: if PTE entry currently in other core's MMU, then the update would be missed. if the first update is A & D, and the second update is A & !D, then the second update will ruin the first
                - racey fix: broadcast PTE entry update to other MMU's
                - maybe amazing fix: only perform bit set's at L3 for PTE update BusWB
                    - already has to be unique since not at block granularity
            - issue: coherent memory could have a new value
                - would be doing BusUpgrade/BusInv when it is possible coherent memory has the block in M. maybe unsupported case for bus. would need to grab M block value and RMW A/D bit set
        - idea: L2 BusRdX
            - spec makes it seem like PTE A/D update must be fully coherent (due to atomic check for update of value at PTE when try to set A/D), so it needs coherent memory value of the PTE. if a new value is found, the translation process is even restarted given the updated PTE
                - this seems like a little much
                - just need atomic A/D sets and should be good to go
            - MMU gives read exclusive request to L2 just like dcache would on a store
                - L2 in E/M already, snoop dcache if in dcache, then good to go
                - otherwise, L2 performs a BusRdX and gets the coherent block in M state
            - perform A/D set for block in L2
                - don't clear any bits in case didn't have up-to-date PTE, only set
            - when done, TLB can be unblocked and allow access causing A/D set to complete
                - iTLB would be blocked unless this process was interrupted
                - dTLB could move on but acts as a dTLB miss for the load or store of interest until returns
