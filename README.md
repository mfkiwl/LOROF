LOROF: Linux-on-RISCV-on-FPGA

<img src="./logo.png" width="320">

The goal of the LOROF project is to architect, design, verify, and validate a RISC-V RV32IMAC_Zicsr_Zifencei Sv32 Quad-Core 4-Way Superscalar Out-of-Order Virtual-Memory-Supporting CPU, successfully booting and running Linux on an FPGA. The project will include RTL designs, UVM based testbenches, C/C++ and RISC-V drivers, and comprehensive documentation.
